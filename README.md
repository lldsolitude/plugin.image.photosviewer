# Apple Photos App plugin for Kodi

This plugin shows an Apple Photos App library in Kodi.  After reading the library database, you will see categories that correspond with their application counterparts:

* Moments
* Albums
* Videos

Your photo library must be reachable over the filesystem from the machine on which you run Kodi.

## Configuration
The plugin needs to know where your Photo Library file is.  The default ("~/Pictures/Photos Library.photoslibrary") is probably not working in all cases. So, please enter the correct path in the plugin's settings dialog.

## Todo
* Use correct timestamp
* Improve sort/view
* Add slideshows/people/places

## License
GPL v2
